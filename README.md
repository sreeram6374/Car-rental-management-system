# Car Rental Management System

A full-stack web application built with **Python (Django)** for backend and **HTML/CSS/Bootstrap** for frontend.  
It digitizes and automates the car rental processâ€”allowing customers to browse, book, and enabling administrators to manage cars and bookings through a secure admin panel.

## Features

Browse available cars with details.
Select preferred rental dates and book a car.

### Admin
Secure admin login.
Add, edit, or remove car listings.
View all user bookings.
Check booked cars and their reserved dates.
Prevent double-booking via date conflict checks.

### Core Logic
Booking Confirmation: Updates status to `Confirmed` if availability and payment (if required) succeed.
